# Personal-Site
I set a goal for myself in June after the 2020-21 school year got out that I wanted to learn some more code. And I decided on HTML/CSS/JS

I wanted to keep my Python fresh but that did not go well, and I decided that I wanted to have a functioning website
up and running by the time school got back in session (approx mid september). So here is where I will be posting my
files and code for the life cycle of the website and its code.

This will also serve as a way for me to get my information to people more quickly and efficiently, whether it be family,
friends, employers, or acquaintences I will have my information more easily accessble to people who want it.

If for some reason you've read this far and want to critique my site or message me about my tech collection, then go for 
it, I'll gladly take any advice or discussion about miscellaneous processors from 2003!
